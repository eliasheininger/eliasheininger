There I was a couple days prior, thinking me and my company had been moving into the right direction. But this morning I got stuck, like really stuck. 
You may have experienced this before. Things become unclear and there is no direction to follow - just a dark forest in front of you making you question where to go. 
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

This essentially left me with 3 options:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

1. Stare at a wall for hours 
2. Justify why what you are persuing is wrong in the first place
3. Try to find a step which will reveal new clarity

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Last of which is probably what you'll feel most resistence towards - but is most likely exactly what will free you from your suffering.
